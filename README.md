# Filian_ARG
Filian ARG javascript decompile attempt


sys_opt.js is the file directly downloaded from the ARG website (https://www.blackfile-index.org/)

sys_opt.js appears to be purposefully obfuscated in Obfuscator.io per online decoders.

sys_opt2.js is the same file with the strings, numbers, and object access substitutions undone per the CodeSandbox version of the Javascript Deobfuscateor here: https://codesandbox.io/p/github/tehmasta/deobfuscator/master


The FilianARG.js file is the file taken from the sys_opt2.js file and hand decoded with a combination of best guesses from me for function and variable names, and replacements to make the hex codes into readable names.
